Default BlowFish seems to be ECB mode (Electronic Code Page = 
simple concatenation of blocks vs CBC which is cipher block
chain).   BlowFish uses a 64 bit block so we can prove this by
encoding a repeating 8char pattern as the plaintext.  ECB
will generate a repeating encoded binary pattern.  Note that
the base64 obfuscates this repeating pattern because of the 6 bit 
representation of 8 bit char offsets block alignments.

java BlowFish "abcdefghabcdefghabcdefgh" 0123456789012345

produces

ciphertxt= MUKVXSDLPPwxQpVdIMs8/DFClV0gyzz8X+zTp4AWlns=
cleartxt= abcdefghabcdefghabcdefgh

But if base64 decode the ciphertext and look at the binary 
values using command

echo  MUKVXSDLPPwxQpVdIMs8/DFClV0gyzz8X+zTp4AWlns= | openssl enc  -base64 -d -out output.ecb

then view the file ecbout in binary mode (:!xxd),  (contents captured in 
file output.bin) looks like

00000000: 3142 955d 20cb 3cfc 3142 955d 20cb 3cfc  1B.] .<.1B.] .<.
00000010: 3142 955d 20cb 3cfc 5fec d3a7 8016 967b  1B.] .<._......{
00000020: 0a                                       .

Notice the repeating pattern every 64 bits.  Since Blowfish is a block
cipher their is some padding happening.....

While ecb is less secure, it is easier to use.   cbc essentially takes
the output of encrypting one block as input to use for encoding of the 
next block.  In this way, repeating patterns are hidden underneath the 
chaining of encrypted material of a given block with the next block.
This also has the nice impact of a single earlier bit changing all the 
subseqent encoding.   However, this mode requires that we provide an
initialization vector as input the enrypting the first block since there
is no preceding block.  This requires that during decoding we have the 
same initialization vector in addition to the password.   

Apparently modes can be specified with something like

Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("Blowfish/CBC/PKCS5Padding"); 
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("Blowfish/EBC/NoPadding"); 

I havent located the documentation that explains this but it maybe
a generic option specfication across different ciphers

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html#alg

shows examples such as

AES/CBC/NoPadding (128)
AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding (128)
AES/ECB/NoPadding (128)
AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding (128)
DES/CBC/NoPadding (56)
DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding (56)
DES/ECB/NoPadding (56)
DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding (56)



Another point to note is that if we use a key size of more than 16 chars,
java may throw an exception indication illegal key size.   This is a
product of the java jvm having policy of weak encryption.  To get 
long key support, you have to install the "Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.
